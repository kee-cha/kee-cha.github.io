        Hello, my name is Kee Cha and I would like to tell all you readers out there a little bit about myself.  I am currently a student enrolled at devCodeCamp in the pursuit of being a software developer.  Although I have no prior knowledge of software development, I have always been interested in technology and trying to be updated with the new trends.  Prior to this new adventure, I was a certified Massage Therapist as well as being a huge fitness junkie.  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I did do my best to stay healthy and in shape.  My reason for heading towards this path was due to a more personal reason.  As a child, I lived in unhealthy life eating junk food and lots of rice. This ultimately led me to being an obese teenager and at a young age of 19, I was diagnose with gall stones.  This began my adventure into a more healthy lifestyle and as of today, I still do my best to watch what I eat as well as exercising on a regular basis.  With my completion of devCodeCamp, I hope to be able to untilize my knowledge of the human body and develop programs that can help users determine causes and effects whether its pain related or just being informative.

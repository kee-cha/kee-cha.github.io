Well what if I told you that the source of the pain was in a different area.  The pain that you feel can be a referral pain and one way to help address the issue is known as "Trigger Point Therapy."  Trigger points are points in the muscle area that are too tight most commonly known by many as "knots."  As the muscle tightens, it constrict the bloodflow which results in a lack of oxygen being delivered to the area.  This would the result in the muscle pulling other areas of the same muscle as it tightens causing discomfort or pain in both areas.</p>
                        <p class="indent">You might be asking "why should you believe what this guy is writing?"  Well to answer that question, my name is Kee Cha and I was a certified massage therapist.  Although I no longer practice massage, I like to maintain my knowledge as well as keep updated on new techniques for my own benefit.  There are many times when I had massaged clients and the pain that they had were caused by the repetitive use of their everyday lives.  My goal here is to help provide another source of information to help people with their pain.  This page is still being updated and as I progress, I will provide more helpful tool and information to help you with your pain.</p>
